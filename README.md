This project is a FastAPI-based web application for predicting heart disease and diabetes using machine learning models. It includes pre-trained models for both predictions, with accompanying datasets and scalers for data preprocessing. The project provides a Jupyter notebook for model training and development, along with HTML templates and static files for a web interface.
